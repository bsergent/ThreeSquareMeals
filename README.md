## Introduction
Eating in Minecraft can get pretty boring, especially with a stack of food from an automatic chicken cooker or cow breeder. This plugin attempts to solve that problem by encouraging players to eat a variety of different foods.

This first big change this plugin makes is the addition of nutrition meters for each food group: fruits, vegetables, grain, protein, and dairy. When these meters are all at least 3/4 full, the your health is normal. When the you neglect any of the food groups, your maximum health begins to decrease to a minimum of three hearts. These decreases are very slow and gradual. As long as you fill each of your meters roughly every five ingame days, you will keep your full ten hearts. If you only eat steak, you'll drop to four and a half hearts. If you only eat steak and drink milk, your health will drop to six hearts. Maintaining all but one food group will result in a maximum health of nine hearts. 

Now I know what you're thinking, "That's just great, now I have to carry around all different types of food that take up even more space in my inventory." Don't worry! I've got you covered.

You know those useless soups and stews that don't stack? I've created a real use for them. Cooking is now more than just throwing some raw meat into a furnace. By placing a pressure plate on top of a furnace, you can create a cooking surface. With this cooking surface, you can create soups, stews, and salads of your own with various ingredients. Throw in some apples with some leaves for a fruit salad. It won't be very filling, but it'll fill up your fruit and vegetable meters. Add some steak, chicken, wheat, apples, carrots, and a bucket of milk for a giant mess of food that's pretty filling and adds to every one of your nutrition meters. Fine tune your ingredients to get the most out of your food's hunger, saturation, and portions. Yes, you can eat your stew just a little at a time and even combine them together to get more hunger value out of a single inventory slot than even a stack of steak.

## Optional Resource Pack
One goal of this plugin is to fit seamlessly into the feel of Minecraft. One major way to do this is with custom GUIs that don't feature a ton of glass panes. This resource pack changes the model and texture for barrier blocks to create blank inventory slots to give the impression of completely custom GUIs. To use it, just add [this resource pack](https://github.com/bsergent/ThreeSquareMeals/wiki/Resource-Pack) to your server's resource pack and enable this option in the ThreeSquareMeals config.

This great model and texture are not originally mine, although I did have to toy with them a bit to make them compatible with more recent versions of Minecraft. They were created for the revolutionary plugin [Craftomated](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/craftomated-cables-quarries-jetpacks-electric-tools-and-more-early-alpha.15065/) by Oberdiah.

## Can I Help?
[Of course](https://github.com/bsergent/ThreeSquareMeals/wiki/How-to-Help)! If you're a programmer, you can help me fix bugs and work on new features. Please submit your pull requests to the *develop* branch. If you're well versed in a language other than English, you can help me translate the various parts of the plugin. If you're good at working through problems or at least documenting them, you can report any bugs you find. If you've got plenty of money, you could donate some of it to me because college makes me poor. If you can't or don't want to help in the other ways, you could always spread the word to your friends.
